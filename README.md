Limitations:
1. Test analysis can be explained on the call (due to time constraints)
2. Think Time / Pacing not implemented, no Workload Modelling available
3. Different type scenarios of load testing (not included due to time constraints)
4. Suggestions on improvements for infrastructure/application is not feasible as its a third party infra. Common suggestions can be explained on call.
